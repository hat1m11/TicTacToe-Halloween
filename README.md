Welcome to my Tic-Tac-Toe game! 🎮 This is a simple yet classic two-player game built using the Processing programming language. Whether you're a fan of X's or O's, this game will bring out your competitive side. Let's see who can get three in a row first!

✨ Features
2-Player Mode: Play with a friend on the same computer.
Interactive Board: Click on the grid to place your X or O.
Dynamic Visuals: Clear and colourful game board layout.
Winner Announcement: The game announces the winner or if it's a draw.
Restart Option: Easily restart the game by pressing the 'R' key.
📋 How to Play
Player 1 starts the game with "X", and Player 2 uses "O".
Players take turns to click on any empty square on the 3x3 grid.
The goal is to get 3 of your marks in a row—either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
If all squares are filled and no one has won, it's a draw!
🛠️ How It Works
The game uses a 2D array to keep track of the board state.
Mouse input is used to detect where players want to place their mark.
The game checks for a winner or a draw after each move.
The grid and marks are drawn using Processing's built-in graphics functions.
